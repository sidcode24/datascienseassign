    "#SQL (Relational Databases)\tNoSQL (Non-relational Databases)\n",
    "Data Model\tFollows a structured data model using tables and schemas.\tOffers flexibility, using various data models like document-oriented, key-value, columnar, or graph-based.\n",
    "Schema\tTypically requires a predefined schema for data organization.\tOften schema-less, allowing flexibility to add or change data structure on-the-fly.\n",
    "Query Language\tUses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying data.\tVarious query languages specific to different NoSQL databases. Some support SQL-like querying, others use custom APIs.\n",
    "Scalability\tVertical scaling (scaling up by adding more resources) is common.\tHorizontal scaling (scaling out by adding more nodes) is more prevalent, allowing distributed databases.\n",
    "Consistency\tEmphasizes ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\tOffers flexibility in consistency models, with some databases favoring eventual consistency.\n",
    "Relationships\tRelational databases use tables with predefined relationships between them (foreign keys, joins).\tNoSQL databases often handle relationships differently, sometimes using denormalization, embedding, or references.\n",
    "Examples\tMySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, etc.\tMongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, DynamoDB, Neo4j, etc.\n",
    "Use Cases\tSuitable for structured data, transactions, and applications with complex relationships.\tIdeal for unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time applications, scalability, and rapid development."
